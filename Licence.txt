MUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

THIS MUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT is made and entered into between Amar Savalagi and any person/company who obtains the copy of the folder containing this Licence file.
Purpose. The parties wish to explore a business opportunity of mutual interest and in connection with this
opportunity, each party may disclose to the other party certain confidential technical and business information which the disclosing party desires the receiving party to treat as confidential.
"Confidential Information" means any information disclosed by either party to the other party, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, including without limitation documents, prototypes, samples, plant and equipment, research, product plans, products, services, customer lists, software, developments, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration, marketing materials or finances, which is designated as "Confidential," "Proprietary" or some similar designation. Information communicated orally shall be considered Confidential Information if such information is confirmed in writing as being Confidential Information within a reasonable time after the initial disclosure. Confidential Information may also include information disclosed to a disclosing party by third parties. Confidential Information shall not, however, include any information which (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the disclosing party to the receiving party through no action or inaction of the receiving party; (iii) is already in the possession of the receiving party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party as shown by the receiving party's files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure; (iv) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party without a breach of such third party's obligations of confidentiality; (v) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party's Confidential Information, as shown by documents and other competent evidence in the receiving party's possession; or (vi) is required by law to be disclosed by the receiving party, provided that the receiving party gives the disclosing party prompt written notice of such requirement prior to such disclosure and assistance in obtaining an order protecting the information from public disclosure.
Non-use and Non-disclosure. Each party shall not use the Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose except to evaluate and engage in discussions concerning a potential business relationship between the parties. Neither party shall disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to third parties. If any party makes copies of the Confidential Information of the other party, such copies shall also constitute Confidential Information and any and all confidential markings on such documents shall be maintained. Neither party shall reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other tangible objects which embody the other party's Confidential Information and which are provided to the party hereunder.
Maintenance of Confidentiality. Each party shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other party. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own most highly confidential information, and shall promptly notify the disclosing party of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information of which it becomes aware. Each party shall disclose Confidential Information only to those officers, directors, employees and contractors who are required to have the information in order to evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the contemplated business relationship, and such party shall remain responsible for compliance with the terms of this Agreement by its officers, directors, employees and contractors.
No Obligation. Nothing herein shall obligate either party to proceed with any transaction between them, and each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by this Agreement concerning the business opportunity.
No Warranty. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS." NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE.
